<h1>First Things First</h1>
<p>Welcome. WordPress is a very special project to me. Every developer and contributor adds something unique to the mix, and together we create something beautiful that I'm proud to be a part of. Thousands of hours have gone into WordPress, and we're dedicated to making it better every day. Thank you for making it part of your world.</p>

<h1>Installation: Famous 5-minute install</h1>
<ol>
	<li>Unzip the package in an empty directory.</li>
	<li>Open up <code>wp-config-sample.php</code> with a text editor like WordPad or similar and fill in your database connection details.</li>
	<li>Save the file as <code>wp-config.php</code></li>
	<li>Upload everything.</li>
	<li>Open <span class="file"><a href="wp-admin/install.php">/wp-admin/install.php</a></span> in your browser. This should setup the tables needed for your blog. If there is an error, double check your <span class="file">wp-config.php</span> file, and try again. If it fails again, please go to the <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/">support forums</a> with as much data as you can gather.</li>
	<li><strong>Note the password given to you.</strong></li>
	<li> The install script should then send you to the <a href="wp-login.php">login page</a>. Sign in with the username <code>admin</code> and the password generated during the installation. You can then click on 'Profile' to change the password.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Upgrading</h1>
<p>Before you upgrade anything, make sure you have backup copies of any files you may have modified such as <code>index.php</code>.</p>
<h2>Upgrading from any previous WordPress to 2.3:</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Delete your old WP files, saving ones you've modified.</li>
	<li>Upload the new files.</li>
	<li>Point your browser to <span class="file"><a href="wp-admin/upgrade.php">/wp-admin/upgrade.php</a>.</span></li>
	<li>You wanted more, perhaps? That's it!</li>
</ol>
<h2>Template Changes</h2>
<p>If you have customized your templates you will probably have to make some changes to them. If you're converting your 1.2 or earlier templates, <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Upgrade_1.2_to_1.5">we've created a special guide for you</a>. </p>
